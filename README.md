This module provides a safe way to execute Python code in a container. It is intended to be used with language models to enable them to execute code in a safe environment separate from the host machine (your computer or server).

The container comes preloaded with the following packages:

```bash
numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance scipy statsmodels sympy bokeh plotly dash networkx pyvis pandas
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install safeexecute
```

## Usage

Set your working directory which is where any potential outputs of the code will be stored. This is also where the code will be executed.

```python
import os
from safeexecute import execute_python_code

working_directory = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "WORKSPACE")
code = "print('Hello, World!')"

result = execute_python_code(code=code, working_directory=working_directory)
print(result)
```
